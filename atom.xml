    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There has been much activity in the past few years in developing web service-based XML execution languages for Business Process Management (BPM) systems. Languages such as WSBPEL provide a formal mechanism for the definition of business processes. The key element of such languages is that they are optimized for the operation and inter- operation of BPM Systems. The optimization of these languages for software operations renders them less suited for direct use by humans to design, manage, and monitor Business Processes. WSBPEL has both graph and block structures and utilizes the principles of formal mathematical models, such as pi-calculus1. This technical underpinning provides the foundation for business process execution to handle the complex nature of both internal and B2B interactions and take advantage of the benefits of Web services. Given the nature of WSBPEL, a complex Business Process could be organized in a potentially complex, disjointed, and unintuitive format that is handled very well by a software system (or a computer programmer), but would be hard to understand by the business analysts and managers tasked to develop, manage, and monitor the Process. Thus, there is a human level of “inter-operability” or “portability” that is not addressed by these web service-based XML execution languages.</p>

<blockquote><p>过去几年中，进行了许多针对业务流程管理（BPM）系统的基于网络服务的XML执行语言开发活动。像WSBPEL这种语言，提供了一种用于定义业务流程的正式机制。这类语言的关键要素是，它们是被优化的用于 BPM系统的操作和互操作。为了软件操作而进行的语言优化使得这些语言在人类设计、管理和监控业务流程方面的适用性降低。WSBPEL具有图结构和块结构，并利用了正式数学模型的原理，如pi-calculus1。该技术基础为执行业务流程来处理内部和B2B交互的复杂性质以及利用网络服务的优势奠定了基础。了解WSBPEL的本质之后，一个复杂的业务流程可组织为潜在复杂的、不相交的、非直观的格式，这种格式软件系统处理起来很容易，只是对于职责是开发、管理和监控流程的业务分析师和管理者来说会很难理解。因此，基于Web服务的XML执行语言不能解决人性层面的“互用性”或“可移植性”。</p></blockquote>

<p>Business people are very comfortable with visualizing Business Processes in a flow-chart format. There are thousands of business analysts studying the way companies work and defining Business Processes with simple flow charts. This creates a technical gap between the format of the initial design of Business Processes and the format of the languages, such as WSBPEL, that will execute these Business Processes. This gap needs to be bridged with a formal mechanism that maps the appropriate visualization of the Business Processes (a notation) to the appropriate execution format (a BPM execution language) for these Business Processes.</p>

<blockquote><p>业务人员感觉用流程图把业务流程可视化很舒适。有成千上万的业务分析师使用简单的流程图来研究企业运作方式和定义业务流程。这样业务流程的最初设计格式和即将执行这些业务流程的语言（如WSBPEL）的格式之间就产生了技术鸿沟。要跨越该鸿沟，需要使用一种将适当的业务流程（一个标注）可视化映射到针对业务流程的适当执行格式（一种BPMN执行语言）的正式机制。</p></blockquote>

<p>Inter-operation of Business Processes at the human level, rather than the software engine level, can be solved with standardization of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). BPMN provides a multiple diagrams, which are designed for use by the people who design and manage Business Processes. BPMN also provides a mapping to an execution language of BPM Systems (WSBPEL). Thus, BPMN would provide a standard visualization mechanism for Business Processes defined in an execution optimized business process language.</p>

<blockquote><p>可以通过标准化业务流程模型和标注（BPMN）在人类层面上解决业务流程互操作，而不是软件引擎层面。BPMN提供了一种多图方式，它由设计和管理业务流程的人设计和使用。BPMN还支持到BPM系统的一种执行语言（WSBPEL）的映射。因此，BPMN给出了一种针对在执行优化业务流程语言下定义的业务流程的标准可视化机制。</p></blockquote>

<p>BPMN provides businesses with the capability of understanding their internal business procedures in a graphical notation and will give organizations the ability to communicate these procedures in a standard manner. Currently, there are scores of Process modeling tools and methodologies. Given that individuals will move from one company to another and that companies will merge and diverge, it is likely that business analysts need to understand multiple representations of Business Processes—potentially different representations of the same Process as it moves through its lifecycle of development, implementation, execution, monitoring, and analysis. Therefore, a standard graphical notation will facilitate the understanding of the performance Collaborations and business transactions within and between the organizations. This will ensure that businesses will understand themselves and participants in their business and will enable organizations to adjust to new internal and B2B business circumstances quickly. BPMN follows the tradition of flowcharting notations for readability and flexibility. In addition, the BPMN execution semantics is fully formalized. The OMG is using the experience of the business process notations that have preceded BPMN to create the next generation notation that combines readability, flexibility, and expandability.</p>

<blockquote><p>BPMN使企业能够通过图形标注来理解内部业务程序并将给予组织机构以标准方式沟通这些程序的能力。目前的流程建模工具和方法论有几十种。已知情况是人员从一个公司流动到另一个公司而公司也会合并和分散，业务分析师很可能要去理解业务流程的多种表现形式&mdash;同一流程在开发、实现、执行、监控和分析周期内推进时的不同表现形式。因此,一个标准的图形标注将有利于理解组织机构内部和之间的行为协作和业务交易。这样可以保证企业将会理解自己和其业务参与者并且将会促使组织机构快速调整来适应新的内部环境和企业对企业业务环境。考虑到可读性和灵活性，BPMN遵循了传统流程图标注。另外BPMN执行语义是完全形式化的. 对象管理组织（OMG）正利用其领先于BPMN的业务流程标注方面的经验优势来创造集可读性、灵活性、和可扩展性为一身的下一代标注规范。</p></blockquote>

<p>BPMN will also advance the capabilities of traditional business process notations by inherently handling B2B Business Process concepts, such as public and private Processes and Choreographies, as well as advanced modeling concepts, such as exception handling, transactions, and compensation.</p>

<blockquote><p>BPMN也将通过在本质上解决B2B业务流程概念，例如公有和私有流程和编舞，以及先进的建模概念，如例外处理、事务和补偿，来提升传统业务流程标注的能力.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>7.1 BPMN Scope</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>7.1  BPMN的范围</p></blockquote>

<p>This specification provides a notation and model for Business Processes and an interchange format that can be used to exchange BPMN Process definitions (both domain model and diagram layout) between different tools. The goal of the specification is to enable portability of Process definitions, so that users can take Process definitions created in one vendor’s environment and use them in another vendor’s environment.</p>

<blockquote><p>本规范为业务流程提供了一种标注和模型和一种能用来将BPMN流程定义（域模型和图上部署）在不同工具间交换的互换格式。本规范的目的是实现流程定义的便捷性以便用户能采用在某一供应商环境下创造的流程定义并将它用于另一个供应商环境。</p></blockquote>

<p>The BPMN 2.0 specification extends the scope and capabilities of the BPMN 1.2 in several areas:<br/>
   + Formalizes the execution semantics for all BPMN elements   + Defines an extensibility mechanism for both Process model extensions and graphical extensions   + Refines Event composition and correlation   + Extends the definition of human interactions   + Defines a Choreography model  This specification also resolves known BPMN 1.2 inconsistencies and ambiguities.</p>

<blockquote><p>BPMN2.0规范在以下领域的范围和能力上对BPMN1.2规范进行了扩展：</p>

<ul>
<li>将针对所有BPMN元素的执行语义正式化</li>
<li>为过程模型扩展和图形扩展定义一个可扩展机制</li>
<li>精化事件的组成和关联</li>
<li>扩展人类交互的定义</li>
<li>定义了一个编舞图模型</li>
</ul>


<p>本规范还解决了已知BPMN1.2中存在的矛盾和模糊的问题。</p></blockquote>

<p>BPMN is constrained to support only the concepts of modeling that are applicable to Business Processes. This means that other types of modeling done by organizations for business purposes is out of scope for BPMN. Therefore, the following are aspects that are out of the scope of this specification:<br/>
    + Definition of organizational models and resources    + Modeling of functional breakdowns    + Data and information models    + Modeling of strategy    + Business rules models  Since these types of high-level modeling either directly or indirectly affects Business Processes, the relationships between BPMN and other high-level business modeling can be defined more formally as BPMN and other specifications are advanced.</p>

<blockquote><p>BPMN被限制为只支持适用于业务流程的建模概念。这意味着组织机构针对业务目的进行的其他类型的建模不在BPMN的规定范围内。所以本规范范围不涵盖以下几个方面：</p>

<ul>
<li>组织模型和资源的定义</li>
<li>功能细分建模</li>
<li>数据和信息模型</li>
<li>战略建模</li>
<li>业务规则模型</li>
</ul>


<p>因为这种高级建模类型要么直接要么间接影响业务过程，所以就像升级BPMN和其他规范那样，BPMN和其他高级业务建模之间的关系可以被更正式地定义。</p></blockquote>

<p>While BPMN shows the flow of data (Messages), and the association of data artifacts to Activities, it is not a data flow language. In addition, operational simulation, monitoring and deployment of Business Processes are out of scope of this specification.</p>

<blockquote><p>虽然BPMN展示了数据（消息）流以及数据人工制品与活动的联合，但是它不是一种数据流语言。此外业务流程的操作模拟、监控和部署都不在本规范范围内。</p></blockquote>

<p>BPMN 2.0 can be mapped to more than one platform dependent process modeling language, e.g., WS-BPEL 2.0. This document includes a mapping of a subset of BPMN to WS-BPEL 2.0. Mappings to other emerging standards are considered to be separate efforts.</p>

<blockquote><p>BPMN 2.0可被映射到至少一种依赖平台的流程建模语言, 例如WS-BPEL 2.0。这个文档包括了一个BPMN子集到WS-BPEL 2.0的映射。那些针对其他新兴标准的映射被认为是单独的成果。</p></blockquote>

<p>The specification utilizes other standards for defining data types, Expressions and service operations. These standards are XML Schema, XPath, and WSDL, respectively.</p>

<blockquote><p>本规范还使用了其他标准来定义数据类型，表达式，服务操作。这些标准分别是XMLschema、Xpath以及WSDL。</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>7.1.1 Uses of BPMN</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>7.1.1 业务流程建模标注的应用</p></blockquote>

<p>Business Process modeling is used to communicate a wide variety of information to a wide variety of audiences. BPMN is designed to cover many types of modeling and allows the creation of end-to-end Business Processes. The structural elements of BPMN allow the viewer to be able to easily differentiate between sections of a BPMN Diagram. There are three basic types of sub-models within an end-to-end BPMN model:  <br/>
1.Processes (Orchestration), including:<br/>
  + Private non-executable (internal) Business Processes    + Private executable (internal) Business Processes    + Public Processes</p>

<p>2.Choreographies<br/>
3.Collaborations, which can include Processes and/or Choreographies<br/>
  + A view of Conversations</p>

<blockquote><p>业务流程建模用来将广泛的信息传递给广大的观众。业务流程建模标注是为了指导多种建模方法而设计并且允许创造端对端业务流程。业务流程建模标注的构件让观众能容易地将业务流程建模标注图的部分进行区分。端对端业务流程模型含有有三种基本子模型：<br/>
1.流程（管弦乐编曲），包括：</p>

<ul>
<li>私有不可执行（内部）业务流程</li>
<li>私有可执行（内部）业务流程</li>
</ul>


<p>2.编舞<br/>
3.协作，它可以包括流程和舞</p>

<ul>
<li>一种对话视图</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Private (Internal) Business Processes</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>私有（内部）业务流程</p></blockquote>

<p>Private Business Processes are those internal to a specific organization. These Processes have been generally called workflow or BPM Processes (see Figure 10.4). Another synonym typically used in the Web services area is the Orchestration of services. There are two types of private Processes: executable and non-executable. An executable Process is a Process that has been modeled for the purpose of being executed according to the semantics defined in Chapter 14. Of course, during the development cycle of the Process, there will be stages where the Process does not have enough detail to be “executable.” A non-executable Process is a private Process that has been modeled for the purpose of documenting Process behavior at a modeler-defined level of detail. Thus, information needed for execution, such as formal condition Expressions are typically not included in a non-executable Process.</p>

<blockquote><p>私有业务流程是一个特定组织的内部流程。这些流程曾经普遍被称为工作流或业务流程管理（BPM）流程（见图10.4）另一个同义词是服务管弦乐编曲，这个词专用于网络服务领域。私有流程有两种类型：可执行的和不可执行的。一个可执行的流程是根据第14章定义的语意以执行为目的而建模的。当然，在该流程的发展周期期间，会出现流程因没有足够细节而成为不可执行的阶段。一个不可执行流程是一个私有流程，是为了在建模者定义的细节水平下将流程行为文档化而建模的。因此执行所需要的信息如证实条件表达式，典型地不包括在不可执行流程中。</p></blockquote>

<p>If a swimlanes-like notation is used (e.g., a Collaboration, see below) then a private Business Process will be contained within a single Pool. The Process flow is therefore contained within the Pool and cannot cross the boundaries of the Pool. The flow of Messages can cross the Pool boundary to show the interactions that exist between separate private Business Processes.</p>

<blockquote><p>如果一个类似泳道的标注（例如一个写作，见下文）被使用，那么一个私有业务流程将会包含在一个单个泳池中。该流程流也因此包含在该泳池中并且不能穿过泳池的边界。消息流可以穿过泳池边界来展示存在于分开的私有业务流程之间的写作。</p></blockquote>
